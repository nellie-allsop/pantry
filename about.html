					<h2>Mission statement</h2>
					<p id="mission">
						We created our company with one aim: to make the lives of everyday
						people just that little bit easier. We all know that people have a
						lot on their plate, and their mental load is so heavy they've got a
						tension headache. Wouldn't it be nice if people had access to a
						little friendly PantryPet, who kept an inventory of their food items
						and helped them with recipe ideas? That's what we set out to do.
