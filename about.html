				<h2>Mission statement</h2>
				<p>
					We created our company with one aim: to make the lives of everyday
					people just that little bit easier. We all know that people have a lot
					on their plate, and their mental load is so heavy they've got a
					tension headache. Wouldn't it be nice if people had access to a little
					friendly PantryPet, who kept an inventory of their food items and
					helped them with recipe ideas? That's what we set out to do.
